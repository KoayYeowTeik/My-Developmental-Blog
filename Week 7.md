## DOM and Local Storage
1. This week i learnt about the DOM tree and how to identify elements easier rather than always using last weeks' three code functions such as child, parent.
2. I also learnt about the usage of local Storage where we can temporarily store key value pairs of local stoage objects in many different pages when the user is directed to another page.
3. I also learnt about event handling where the javascript will read elements that are interacted by the user.
