## Javascript Objects and DOM
1. This week i learnt about OOP and objects.
   The idea of assigning attributes to every object 
   using key value pairs.
2. I also learnt about DOM objects where we use javascript to identify html elements for further modifications with querySelector or getElementById/Class.
