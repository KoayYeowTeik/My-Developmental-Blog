## SEMANTIC HTML
1. This week i learnt a bit more on simple HTML tags such as form, input and other special tags.
2. I also learnt about the usage of div/header/section tags to group child tags together to make styling easier
3. I learnt about the usage of the style.css file to be linked by link rel stylesheet tags that will connect the css file to the HTML file which will make styling easier along with encasing tags with class or ID attributes.
4. I also learnt simple css techiniques such as color,background, hover, after and many more.
