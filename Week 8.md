## jQuery and API
1. This week i learnt about the usage of jQuery to make my code easier to read and easier to code without long pure DOM codes with the $("")
2. I also learnt about APIs where we can fetch JSON objects where we can then using JSON.parse.
3. Some extra learning of async functions to make the page still load some info while getting other information from another site.
